Two brothers destined to change the world...

Aric and Fadan are half-brothers and sons of the Empress. A
decade earlier, Fadan's powerful father tore the Empire in two by outlawing the
use and practice of magic. When Aric and Fadan stumble upon an ancient Manual
of Magic, they're faced with a choice: take the book straight to the Emperor or
see if one of them has the forbidden magical talent. 

After tragedy and conspiracy send Aric and Fadan to either
end of the Empire, one trains to serve with the Dragon Hunters while the other
taps into magical powers that could spell his execution. In a world of dark
mages, massive creatures, and vengeful gods, only friendship, loyalty, and love
can keep the brothers from meeting their doom.

_The Dragon Hunter and
the Mage_ is the first book in a series of coming of age epic fantasy
novels. If you like fast-moving plots, magical world building, and political
intrigue, then you'll love Vasco Cardoso's realistic, spellbinding tale.
